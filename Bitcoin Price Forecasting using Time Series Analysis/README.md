## Bitcoin Price Forecasting: A Comprehensive Time Series Analysis Integrating Statistical Models and Machine Learning Techniques Report

The following insights can be derived:

1-Research Objective: The objective of the study is to forecast the price of Bitcoin using a combination of statistical models and machine learning techniques.

2-Research Questions: The study aims to answer questions related to the accuracy and performance of various forecasting models in predicting Bitcoin prices.

3-Scope: The research focuses on analyzing Bitcoin price data from January 2015 to the current date, using daily intervals.

4-Forecasting Models: The study explores the effectiveness of different models such as Prophet, ARIMA, SARIMA, GARCH, LSTM, and XGBoost in forecasting Bitcoin prices.

5-LSTM Model Performance: The LSTM model emerges as the top performer with remarkable accuracy, demonstrating a low Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 637.830, a minimal Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 2.368%, and a precise Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 903.149. The LSTM model shows proficiency in capturing complex temporal dependencies in Bitcoin price data, achieving an accuracy rate of 97.66%.

6-GARCH Model Performance: The GARCH model excels in addressing volatility aspects, as indicated by its competitive RMSE of 3.516, MAE of 3.031, and notable MAPE of 28.902%.

7-Comparing Models: The results suggest that LSTM is an adept pattern recognizer, while GARCH effectively handles volatility, making them the top-performing models for Bitcoin price forecasting.

8-Data Retrieval and Pre-processing: The study includes a detailed description of the methodology used for data retrieval, pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, and model implementation.

9-Evaluation Metrics: Various evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE) are used to assess the performance of the forecasting models.

10-Empirical Findings: The study provides empirical findings that demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating statistical models and machine learning techniques for Bitcoin price forecasting.

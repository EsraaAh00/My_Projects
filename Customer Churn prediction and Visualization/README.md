# Churn Analysis Project
## Overview
This project aims to analyze customer churn using SQL for data processing, Power BI for data visualization, and a Random Forest machine learning model for prediction.

## Project Structure
	1- Data Extraction and Preparation
		- SQL Queries: Used to extract and clean the data from the database.
		- Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and data transformation.
	2- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
		- Power BI: Visualize key metrics and identify trends.
		- Key Metrics: Customer demographics, service usage, churn rate.
	3- Feature Engineering
		- Creating new features based on existing data to improve model performance.
	4- Model Building
		- Machine Learning Model: Random Forest classifier.
		- Model Training: Splitting data into training and testing sets, parameter tuning.
	5- Model Evaluation
		- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC curve.
	6- Results Visualization
		- Power BI Dashboards: Interactive visualizations for business stakeholders.

## Technologies Used
	- SQL: For data extraction and preparation.
	- Power BI: For data visualization and interactive dashboards.
	- Python: For building and evaluating the machine learning model.

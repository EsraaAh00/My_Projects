# Esraa Ahmed - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Esraa! I hold a Master's degree in Business Analytics from MCIT, where I developed a robust foundation in life sciences and a deep passion for leveraging data to uncover meaningful insights. I am eager to apply my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data analyst.

My academic journey has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of data analysis and visualization methodologies across various tools, fostering expertise in extracting strategic insights from data. In addition, my one year of experience in software development has enhanced my proficiency in database management, SQL, and Python, as well as statistical analysis.

Throughout my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex datasets, developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends, and gained hands-on experience in data management, and statistical analysis. These skills will be invaluable in my role as a data analyst.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, always seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. I thrive both in collaborative team environments and when working independently, driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

I am excited to bring my expertise and enthusiasm to a data analyst position, where I can contribute to impactful data-driven decision-making and continuous learning.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Bitcoin Price Forecasting using Time Series Analysis
**Code:** [`Code_Implementation.ipynb`](https://github.com/EsraaAh00/My_Projects/blob/af8dd4574f805e6d89bb8b966b817e9cfc109327/Bitcoin%20Price%20Forecasting%20using%20Time%20Series%20Analysis/Code_Implementation.ipynb)

**Goal:** The objective of the study is to forecast the price of Bitcoin using a combination of statistical models and machine learning techniques.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing Bitcoin price data from January 2015 to the current date, using daily intervals. The study explores the effectiveness of different models such as Prophet, ARIMA, SARIMA, GARCH, LSTM, and XGBoost in forecasting Bitcoin prices. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation and implemented statistical analysis. Various evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE) are used to assess the performance of the forecasting models.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, Time Series Analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** LSTM Model Performance: The LSTM model emerges as the top performer with remarkable accuracy, demonstrating a low Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 637.830, a minimal Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 2.368%, and a precise Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 903.149. The LSTM model shows proficiency in capturing complex temporal dependencies in Bitcoin price data, achieving an accuracy rate of 97.66%.GARCH Model Performance: The GARCH model excels in addressing volatility aspects, as indicated by its competitive RMSE of 3.516, MAE of 3.031, and notable MAPE of 28.902%.The results suggest that LSTM is an adept pattern recognizer, while GARCH effectively handles volatility, making them the top-performing models for Bitcoin price forecasting.

### Customer Churn Analysis
**Code:** [`CustomerChurn-RandomForestModel.ipynb`](https://github.com/EsraaAh00/My_Projects/blob/b34ef08bd9fb4998ef51453129313024f9a24ce9/Customer%20Churn%20prediction%20and%20Visualization/CustomerChurn-RandomForestModel.ipynb)

**Goal:** This project aims to analyze customer churn using SQL for data processing, Power BI for data visualization, and a Random Forest machine learning model for prediction.

**Description:** In today's competitive business landscape, retaining customers is essential for long-term success. Churn analysis helps understand and reduce customer attrition by examining customer data to identify patterns and reasons behind their departures. Through advanced data analytics and machine learning, businesses can predict which customers are likely to leave and understand the factors influencing their decisions. This insight enables companies to take proactive measures to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.

**Skills:** Data Extraction and Cleaning with SQL, Data Visualization with Power BI, Machine Learning Model Building and Evaluation with Python.

**Technology:** SQL: Used for extracting and cleaning data from the database, Power BI: Utilized for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards, Python: Employed for building the Random Forest classifier and evaluating its performance.

**Results:** The churn analysis project yielded significant insights through the Random Forest model. The confusion matrix revealed 777 true negatives, 59 false positives, 138 false negatives, and 228 true positives. The classification report showed an overall accuracy of 84%, with the precision, recall, and F1-scores for non-churners being 0.85, 0.93, and 0.89, respectively, and for churners being 0.79, 0.62, and 0.70, respectively. Feature importance analysis identified total revenue, contract type, and total charges as the top predictors, offering valuable insights for targeted customer retention strategies.

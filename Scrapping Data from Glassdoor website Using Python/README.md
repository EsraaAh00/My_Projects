# Project Description
* The project focuses on extracting job listing data from Glassdoor using web scraping techniques. This data is then processed and analyzed to uncover trends and insights in the job market. The project covers the following aspects:
* Web scraping using Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Selenium.

# Data Collection
* The data collection process involves:

* Navigating to the Glassdoor job search page.
* Extracting job titles, company names, locations, salaries, ratings, and job descriptions.
* Handling pagination to collect data from multiple pages.

## Web Scraping
Tweaked the web scraper github repo (above) to scrape 1000 job postings from glassdoor.com. With each job, we got the following:
*	Job title
*	Salary Estimate
*	Job Description
*	Rating
*	Company 
*	Location
*	Company Headquarters 
*	Company Size
*	Company Founded Date
